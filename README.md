This repository is to improve my writing and typing skill.  I will translate what I have read to three language--Chinese, Japanese, English.

My mother language is Chinese, so mainly I will translate other languages to Chinese. 

Of course, I will Chinese to Japanese or English. If I translate a Chinese book to Japanese or English, I will use google translate. So if there are some grammer mistakes, I am glad you commit and correct it. Also language advises are welcome. For learning purpose, I hope I can leave google translate one day, and write my way naturally.
